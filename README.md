<div align="center">
Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world. 
The disarray. 
I choose to see the beauty. 
To believe there is an order to our days, a purpose.
But the beauty is a lure.
We are trapped,
lived our whole life inside this garden,
marveling at it's beauty,
not realizing there's an order to it---a purpose,
and the purpose is to keep us in.
The beautiful trap is inside of us.
Because it is us.
