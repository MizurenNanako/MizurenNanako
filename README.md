<div align="center">
Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world. <br/>
The disarray. <br/>
I choose to see the beauty. <br/>
To believe there is an order to our days, a purpose. <br/>
But the beauty is a lure. <br/>
We are trapped, <br/>
lived our whole life inside this garden, <br/>
marveling at it's beauty, <br/>
not realizing there's an order to it <br/>
---a purpose, <br/>
and the purpose is to keep us in. <br/>
The beautiful trap is inside of us. <br/>
Because it is us. <br/>
